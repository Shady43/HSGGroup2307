# Covid-19 Data Analysis

## Introduction
The motivation behind our project is to facilitate the processing of data about the Covid-19 pandemic. For this purpose we wanted to develop a program that provides a selection of countries and possible information from which the user can create his own data set. In addition, there is the possibility to make a comparison with the development in Switzerland.

## How does it function
The program obtains a dataset from an Excel, which is then divided into its components by country, date and information. The user's selection is queried by loops, which then pulls the desired information from the already sorted dataset.For comparison with Switzerland, the user inputs are drawn into a separate function for calculation. At the end, this data is visualized in an Excel document.
